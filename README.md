_________ Update 05/04/2022 __________

The existing program was refactored to have a neater look, and to make it easier to work with.
Here I will explain line by line how each function works. I am not sure if the program is 100% correct, so, I am open to improvements and dicussions :).


The purpose of this program was to compute the dependent variables needed to confirm/infirm the hypotheses. 

Score Parameter Calculations:

The score parameter calculations are performed in the function DisplaySc
INPUTS: Data - the struct dataset given to us; Choice - 1/2, if a choice of 1 is selected, the score parameter for each of the six subjects will be plotted, considering all three levels of the indepentdent variable
if a choice of 2 is selected, the data from all the subjects will be summarized in an errorbar plot showing the mean and two standard deviations.

OUTPUTS: Graphs as presented, depending on the choice of the user.

The variable "names" will obtain the names of the fields of the data, i.e "data_subj_x", in order to facilitate easier looping in the for loop.
Empty arrays are initialized in order to be able to append data required for each level of the independent variable
A loop is created which goes through which each subject. "subj" is used to access the data corresponding to a certain subject.
Now, it is time to construct the arrays:
First the variances for the error and target signal are calculated. This means that, there will be 5 variances,
since each subject and each condition performed the experiment five times in order to have stable measurements. 
After the 5 variances were obtained, they will be averaged, to obtain the average performance per subject per condition.
The target signal variance is not averaged, due to the fact that we have only one measurement of this variable.

After data from all the subjects was calculated, the variable "MatSigSc", concatenates all the data from each condition,
the dimension of the matrix is 6x3 - 6 subjects, 3 conditions, therefore, one row will represent the score parameter for one subject where all the three conditions are tested.

The rest of the function represents the plotting.

Control signal variance:

The control signal variance is calculated in the function DisplaySigU
INPUTS: Data - the struct dataset given to us; Choice - 1/2, if a choice of 1 is selected, the score parameter for each of the six subjects will be plotted, considering all three levels of the indepentdent variable
if a choice of 2 is selected, the data from all the subjects will be summarized in an errorbar plot showing the mean and two standard deviations.

OUTPUTS: Graphs as presented, depending on the choice of the user.

The approach followed in this case is similar to the one presented above.

Concatenating the frequency response function is defined in the function ConcatFresp
INPUTS: Data - the struct dataset given to us; Choice - 'C'/'CP'/'CM' the condition/independent variable for which the concatenated frequency response is calculated

OUTPUTS:  Mag - an array of dimension n.datapoints x 30, which has the magnitudes for all the subjects and trials.
Phase - an array of dimension n.datapoints x 30, which has the magnitudes for all the subjects and trials.

Computing the averaged frequency response is performed in the function AverageData
INPUTS: Data - the struct dataset given to us; Choice - 'C'/'CP'/'CM' the condition/independent variable for which the concatenated frequency response is calculated

OUTPUTS:  Mag - an array of dimension n.datapoints x 30, which has the magnitudes for all the subjects and trials.
Phase - an array of dimension n.datapoints x 30, which has the magnitudes for all the subjects and trials.

First, the concatenated data is imported. This magnitude and phase data is combined in the complex number representation.
The real parts and the imaginary parts are averaged, and, in the end the magnitude and phase values for the averaged response are obtained back.

Now, it it time to try to estimate the five parameters of the pilot model, as presented in the assignment.
This is being done with the help of the function optimize.
INPUTS: Data - the struct dataset given to us; Choice - 'C'/'CP'/'CM' the condition/independent variable for which the concatenated frequency response is calculated

OUTPUTS:  elements - an array with the estimated parameters of the "lumped" pilot model

Firstly, we make use of the averaged frequency response, since we would like to fit a model to this averaged response.
Now, we are using a function handler to transform the function with four inputs, to a function of one input - params.

The objective function wants to minimize the squared absolute value difference between the "raw" frequency response at the given 
discrete frequency values and the model given by us at the same values.

Params0 is the initial condition of the five parameters.

After we have the pilot parameters, we want to create some plots, to see whether the model follows well the discrete data given.
This is being done in the function plot_freq_domain.
INPUTS: w- the desired freqency range where, the pilot model is computed, Data - the struct dataset given to us; Choice - 'C'/'CP'/'CM' the condition/independent variable for which the concatenated frequency response is calculated,
whatplot -'Pilot'/'Combined', the desired plots, 'Pilot' will only plot the frequency response of the pilot block, 'Combined' will only plot the frequency response of the open loop.

OUTPUTS: [total_abs, total_phase], the magnitude and phase of the open loop response, which is used in other functions. TODO - for phase margin and crossover frequency.

The variable 'pilot_params' contains the output of the previous functiuons, but, now it is time to construct the model, therefore to substitute the computed parameters in the pilot model.
This is being done in the variable yy. The following lines contain some corrections for the phase calculations, since MATLAB induces several ambiguities when a phase value is computed from a complex number.
Other two variables are included: ss, nn which is the magnitude and phase information of the controlled element, as neeeded for plotting the open loop response.
Finally, the plotting is done and the outputs are defined (open loop magnitude and phase).

Lastly, the pilot parameters are presented in the function dispPilotParams

TODO in the near future, automatic calculations of the phase margin and crossover frequency
